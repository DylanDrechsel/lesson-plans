// Homework for Variables
// DONT BE AFRAID TO REFERENCE variables.js
// Look for patterns and find out what needs to be replaced
// You can also copy and paste from the other file and just changes the variables

// Terminal Commands --> These will make up msot of the commands you use in the terminal
// pwd (print working direectory) --> Will show you where you are in your terminal
// ls (list files) --> will show you all 
// cd <directory name> (change directory) --> Will take you to the folder of your choice
// code . --> Will open all files in the directory in vsCode

// How to open up your file --> Open your terminal and navigate to your directory
//                              where you have been saving our class lessons

// How to run your code --> Make sure you are in the directory that has the file you
//                          want to run. Then type node <file name>. Then the code should
//                          run in the terminal and display any error the code encounters
// Example: node variables.js

// Console Logs
// Example
// write a line that console logs the result from 12 - 5
console.log(12 - 5) // --> Returns 7

// write a line that console logs the result from 5 + 5


// write a line that console logs the result from 8 * 2


// write a line that console logs the result from 5 / 5


// write a line that console logs the wether 6 is even (0) or odd (1)
// remember the special divide operator (%) will only return 0 or 1


// write a line that console logs the wether 101 is even (0) or odd (1)


// write a line the prints out 'End of Console Logs Section' so your terminal is easier to read

// -------------------------> Most Common Programming Case Types <-------------------------

// url link: https://chaseadams.io/posts/most-common-programming-case-types/

//                                  camelCase --> This is the one were going to use!
// camelCase must (1) start with a lowercase letter and (2) the first letter of every new
// subsequent word has its first letter capitalized and is compounded with the previous word.
// An example of camel case of the variable camel case var is camelCaseVar.

// example: hello world --> helloWorld
// example: my street address --> myStreetAddress

//                                  snake_case
// snake_case is as simple as replacing all spaces with a "_" and lowercasing all the words.
// It's possible to snake_case and mix camelCase and PascalCase but imo, that ultimately
// defeats the purpose.
// An example of snake case of the variable snake case var is snake_case_var.

//                                  kebab-case
// kebab-case is as simple as replacing all spaces with a "-" and lowercasing all the words.
// It's possible to kebab-case and mix camelCase and PascalCase but that ultimately defeats
// the purpose.
// An example of kebab case of the variable kebab case var is kebab-case-var.

// There are other types but they arent used all that much. If you want to see them reference
// the chaseadams url above.

// REMEMBER UPPER AND LOWERCASE MATTER!

// Variables
// Example
//    Variable Name     Variable Value
const exampleVariable = 'example'
// Remember to use the `` (located to the left of the '1' key) to be able to copy the line below
console.log(`This is an ${exampleVariable} for you guys!`) // Returns 

// Create a variable named 'name' with a string of your name

// Write a line that prints out 'hello my name is 'name''


// Create a variable named 'age' with a number of your age

// Write a line that prints out 'My age is 'age''

// Arrays
// Example
//    Array Name     Array Value
const classMembers = ['Dylan', 'Chase', 'Matta', 'Joe']
